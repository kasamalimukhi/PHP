    <li>What Is Object Oriented Programming?<br>
        <b>Ans :</b><br>
        Object-oriented programming has a sweeping impact because it appeals at multiple levels and promises faster and
        cheaper development and maintenance. It follows a bottom-up approach to develop applications. <br>
        The word object-oriented is the combination of two words i.e. object and oriented. The dictionary meaning of the
        object is an article or entity that exists in the real world. The meaning of oriented is interested in a
        particular kind of thing or entity. In layman's terms, it is a programming pattern that rounds around an object
        or entity are called object-oriented programming. <br>
        It is the most popular programming model among developers. It is well suited for programs that are large,
        complex, and actively updated or maintained. It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing
        major concepts such as abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. These core concepts support
        OOP.<br>

        A real-world example of OOP is the automobile. It more completely illustrates the power of object-oriented
        design.<br>
